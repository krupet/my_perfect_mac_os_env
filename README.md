# What is this ???
Just a dump repository with .bashrc/.vimrc files for my repository that describes my current environment setup.
Most stuff relates to zsh/vim/Intellij IDEA setup.

## Intellij idea setup

I prefer [same setup](https://github.com/izhangzhihao/intellij-rainbow-brackets#authors-choice) as author of [Rainbow Brackets](https://github.com/izhangzhihao/intellij-rainbow-brackets) plugin.

I had an issue with hot-keys on mackbook pro with touchbar - some of my usual key combination wasn't working, for example Shift + F6.
Turnsout the rootcause was in Karabiner-Elements - it has some kind of conflicts with touchbar! So quiting Karabiner helped.
More detail [here](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000087984-Shift-F6-rename-or-Shift-F-is-invalid)

Favorite plugins: Rainbow brackets, Nya cat progress bar.
